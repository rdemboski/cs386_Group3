# How to contribute
It is recommended to write all contributions using Visual Studio 2019: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/

All contributions should be submitted as pull requests to the main branch. Please try to have detailed description of the changes you make as well as a self-describing name for your pull request.

If an issue exists for the change you're making, reference it in your pull request description.

If you're creating a new model/controller, make sure to model the logic in a unit test.

**Coding conventions**\
In general, using the default linter for Visual Studio should cover most of our coding conventions, but otherwise:

```c#
public int dummy(int input)
  {
    return 0;
  }
```

Follow this template for most functions.
